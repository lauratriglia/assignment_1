In this repository you will find all the package required for the construction of a 2D robot whose goal is to achieve a target. Let me explain all the directory which are in this repository

\subsubsection*{my\+\_\+srv}

In this package you will find
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A subfolder /srv cointains Server1.\+srv -\/$>$ it contains all the paramaters that the Server1 required and the parameters that are returned.
\item A subfolder /src contains \hyperlink{random__server_8cpp}{random\+\_\+server.\+cpp} -\/$>$ the scope of this code is to provide a random position in a specific interval \mbox{[}-\/6.\+6\mbox{]}. Tha random position is given as input and the code returns it to /robot \+\_\+ controller node
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{robot}

In this package you will find
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A subfolder /src contains \hyperlink{robot__controller_8cpp}{robot\+\_\+controller.\+cpp} -\/$>$ it manages the motion of the robot and asks to the server a new target when the previous one is reached
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{How the node communicate to each other}



\subsection*{How to run the code\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item As first step it is necessary to run a command to create the master 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 roscore & 
\end{DoxyCode}

\item As second step run the simulation space with 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rosrun stage\_ros stageros $(rospack find assignment1)/world/exercise.world
\end{DoxyCode}

\item As third step in another shell use the command to run the server 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rosrun my\_srv random\_server
\end{DoxyCode}

\item As last step, in another shell, use the command to run the robot\+\_\+controller 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rosrun roboy robot\_controller
\end{DoxyCode}
 
\end{DoxyItemize}
